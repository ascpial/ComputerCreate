This python scripts helps you create a zip file of the resource pack, without
including source files, python scripts and documentation.

The scripts simply find all png, json (for models) and mcmeta files in the
assets folder and adds pack.mcmeta and pack.png to the archive.

The zip file is sent to the output folder (which is ignored by git), but you
can also choose to copy it to your minecraft resourcepacks folder or whatever
you want to help you test the pack.

In the future, the program will automatically detect changes and update the
pack if needed.
